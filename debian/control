Description: program for applying patches with conflicting changes
 Wiggle is a program for applying patches that 'patch' cannot
 apply due to conflicting changes in the original.
 .
 Wiggle will always apply all changes in the patch to the original.
 If it cannot find a way to cleanly apply a patch, the change is
 inserted in the original in a manner similar to 'merge', and
 an unresolvable conflict is reported.
 .
 Wiggle can replace diff, patch, or merge, and can operate at either
 the line or the word level.

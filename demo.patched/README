This is demo file for wiggle's --browse mode.

Browse mode is intended to let you look through a patch
to see how it will apply to a set of files.  It is 
possible that the patch will have some conflicts.
That is: the patch was created from a different version of
the source to the version that you are applying the patch
to.  This is what makes it interesting.

You can use normal cursor motion to scroll around,
both vertially and horizontally (both emacs and vi style).
From the initial file-list patch, use space
or <return> to open/close a directory or file.
Form the file-view mode, use 'q' to get back to
to file list.

Differences applied by the patch are shown as
RED for removal and BLUE for addition.
Text with a pink background was not matched -
maybe it has been changed since the patch was
created.

green-background text is text that the patch wants
to change, but the exact correct change has already
been made.

Captial-N might go to the next interesting chunk
of the file.

You can use 'o' and 'r' to view the original or result.
You can use 'b' and 'a' to view the before or after
sides of the patch.
You can use 'd' to view the diff (patch, before and
after) or 'm' to view the merge (original and result).

'|' returns to the original split-window view with
merge on the left and diff on the right.

Have fun.

---------------------------------------
This demonstrates where a diff on one line
applies to text that is now split

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy hound.

------------

This demonstrates a diff which contains some
extraneous lines.
(this is an extra line)

The quick brown she 
fox jumps over the lazy cat.

There will be extra lines in the diff
(as is this)

--------------

Here are some lines
without any mention of
a clear conflict

--------------

Two dissimilar lines,
both having changes
